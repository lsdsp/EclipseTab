# Privacy Policy for Eclipse Tab

**Last Updated:** 2026/01/19

Eclipse Tab ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
**We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.**

* **Local Storage:** All data generated by Eclipse Tab, including your Zen Shelf notes, stickers, Focus Spaces configurations, Dock apps, and custom wallpapers, is stored strictly on your local device using your browser's `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` technologies.
* **No Cloud Sync:** We do not have a backend server. Your data never leaves your browser environment unless you manually export it.

## 2. External Services
Eclipse Tab interacts with third-party services only in the following specific scenarios:
* **Search Suggestions (Optional):** Search suggestion capability is optional. If enabled, your query text is sent directly to the selected search engine provider (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) to retrieve auto-completion suggestions. If not enabled, basic manual search remains available.
* **Favicons:** To display website icons in the Dock, Eclipse Tab first tries icon paths from the target website itself (such as `apple-touch-icon` or `favicon.ico`).
* **Third-Party Icon Service (Optional):** This feature is disabled by default. Only after you enable and confirm it, the site domain may be sent to a third-party icon service to retrieve favicon assets.

## 3. User Consent
By installing and using Eclipse Tab, you consent to the local processing of data as described in this policy.
